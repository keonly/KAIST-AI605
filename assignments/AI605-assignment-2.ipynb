This process typically involves a general objective, like predicting the next word in a sequence (language modelling), which allows the model to gain a broad understanding of the language. The resulting model can capture a lot of the syntax, semantics, and even some of the world knowledge embedded in the training data.\n",

    "This schedule benefits the training of transformer models in several ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the beginning of training, when weights are initialised (often randomly), the model's predictions are likely far from optimal. Thus, a higher learning rate allows the model to make larger updates and converge faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "As training progresses, the model starts to fit the data more closely, and the loss landscape becomes more intricate with narrower regions of interest. Here, using a high learning rate might make the model overshoot these narrow regions. Hence, reducing the learning rate as training goes on allows the model to make finer adjustments and potentially settle into deeper, narrower parts of the loss function (i.e., local minima).\n",
    "\n",
    "If the learning rate was constant, with high learning rates, the model might bounce around and miss the local minima, while extremely low learning rates might make the model converge too slowly or get stuck in less optimal minima. The inverse square root schedule tries to get the best of both worlds by starting fast and then slowing down, allowing the model to navigate the complex loss landscape of Transformer models effectively.\n"
