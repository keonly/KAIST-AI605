# KAIST AI605: Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing

## Prerequisites
- **Resources**: Students should use their own GPU or use the departmental VESSL cluster. If not available, cloud-based services such as Google Colab can be used.
- **Prerequisites**: It is recommended to take a class such as AI501 machine learning, AI502 deep learning, or  AI504 programming for AI.
- **Follow-on**: After completion of the course, topics such as AI620 Bias and ethics in NLP (Spring Semester 2024) and AI705 Language Models (Fall and Spring 2024) are recommended

## Assessment
- 4x Problem-based Assignments (90%) Assignments must be completed individually
  1. Recurrent Neural Networks
  2. Transformers
  3. Knowledge Intensive / Open Domain NLP
  4. Modular / Efficient NLP
- Attendance + In-lab or In-lecture Quiz (10%)

Late days: 4 free late days will be provided for the student to use as they wish, shared between all assignments. After late days are exhausted, 10% penalty per day per assignment will be awarded.
